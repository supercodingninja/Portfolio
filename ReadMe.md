## Repository Description
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Have you ever considered creating a portfolio?  Whether you're looking for a partitime position, or even, landing a full-time career, a portfolio can assist you in showcasing talents ad skills.  You will know that you have an effective portfolio, when you strengths are highlited, along with displaying your thought process (don't just commit your git Devs., explain what you are doing/attempting to accomplish).  People who take the time to create a portfolio, often have web applications deployed (live urls, webpages, web sites, content on the web); and these same individuals are typically those successful in their career search (whether it's after an educational institution, coding bootcamp, self-taught studies, etc.): becausemany companies and employers require canidates for hire to have several web applications/projects deployed, as a minimal satndard to recieve an intial interview.  If you have not done any of this, and you're wondering why it seems you're overlooked by potential employers, this may/may not be the reason: so, I encourage you to consider this repsoitory, and take it to heart.  In order to be a successful developer, you must act and believe you are one ("Feel until it' real"- Dr. Eric Thomas).  Remember this also, as a developer, your goal should be designing experiences that makes people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even knew they had, even better, in a way that they did not understand: We are the super heroes and heriones of tomorrow; so get coding, and I hope this repository helps you along your development. - [Frederick Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/discoverfrederickthomas/), Super Coding Ninja™

## Repositiory End-Goal Criterea
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Given that we met our Users' Stories, we want to accomplish the following criterea:

    1.   Deploy a live url from this application.
    2.   Our application loads with no errors.
    3.   Our GitHub repository contains application code (showcase your work and thought process).
    4.   Our application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the demo (can we follow the designer's plan, even if you do not like it).
    5.   Our repository should have a unique name.
    6.   Our repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
    7.   Our repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
    8.   Our repository contains multiple descriptive commit messagesm(again, showcase your thought process).
    9.   As you've seen in my repository, it's a good idea that your repository contains quality readme with description, screenshot, link to deployed application.

## Future Project
